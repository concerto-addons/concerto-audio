# Concerto 2 Audio Plugin
This plugin provides support to add audio content in Concerto 2, such as shoutcast.

1.  Add to your Gemfile: ```gem 'concerto_audio'```
2.  ```bundle install```
3.  ```./script/rails generate concerto_audio:install install```

The last step produces a lot of output because it recompiles the frontend js files.
